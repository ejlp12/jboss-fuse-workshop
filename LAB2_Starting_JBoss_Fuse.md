# LAB 02 â€“ STARTING THE JBOSS FUSE SERVER FROM THE COMMAND LINE

Open a Terminal window on your machine, and cd to the JBoss Fuse installation directory (e.g.
`~/Servers/jboss-fuse-6.1.0.redhat-379`). From there, execute `bin/fuse` (or `bin\fuse.bat`) to
start JBoss Fuse.

By default, JBoss Fuse will start in interactive mode, which means it both starts the server, and displays the
command Console. There are startup options to refine this, such as `bin/fuse server` to just start the
server without the Console, and `bin/fuse client` to start just the Console that will connect to a locally
running server.

```
Please wait while JBoss Fuse is loading...

how to run JBoss Fuse from within Fuse IDE. Run the following to shut down JBoss Fuse
